            <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>Way back when dinosaurs like the Commodore 64 first ruled the Earth, in the years before BluRay, before DVD's, before CD's, before disks of any kind, I spent hours typing out programs from magazines so my younger brother and sister could play them.  Sometimes there were bugs in the code, sometimes I typed it wrong but I always found the error and fixed it... and as long as no one turned off the computer, we were set!  Thankfully it wasn't long until we got a tape player and at least could save the programs for later!</p>

            <div class="half-width">
              <p> Since then I've played around with different languages.  I've coded macros in WordBasic, (not VisualBasic, WordBasic) and loved the challenge of making things work the way I wanted them to. I've created Excel spreadsheets to look up and display information based on a product code.  I wanted to build a more sophisticated interface, but didn't have the tools for the job.  This peaked my curiousity and I couldn't seem to let it go.  The world of web development is just opening for me, but the possibilities are endless. </p>

              <p>I combine clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML with content that is easy to read, easy to collaborate on, problem free and accessible to make Grandma's best HTML-Banana Bread.</p>

              <h3>CSS Snickerdoodles</h3>
              <p> I enjoy writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I love staying up to date on current best practices.  And the cinnamon and sugar coating has to be the best!</p>

              <h3>Converting patterns into projects</h3>
              <p> From pattern to project to knit blankets and more.  Other than spoiling my grandchildren, nothing is more fun than taking a complex pattern and turning it into a completed project. I've completed rosaries and cross stitch patterns too so you can see I work with a variety of mediums.</p>
